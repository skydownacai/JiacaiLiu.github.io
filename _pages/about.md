About Me
======
I am currently a third-year PhD student at Fudan University, and my research interest is Reinforcement Learning. Prior to entering my PhD program, I completed a two-year master's degree in statistics at Fudan University and earned a bachelor's degree in management from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.



Education
======

* **Ph.D in Reinforcement Learning, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), (2023-2026)**

  *Supervisor : [Ke Wei](https://makwei.github.io/)*

* **M.S. in Statistics, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), (2021 - 2023)**

* **B.M. in [Shanghai University of Finance and Economic](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/), (2017 - 2021)**

  *I rank 1st in GaoKao in Guangyuan City, Sichuan Province*
  
  

Research Interests
======

My research  primarily focuses on the Reinforcement Learning (RL), including: 1. Theoretical analysis and algorithm design in RL.  2. The application of RL in large scale real-world problems. I'm also interested in the combination of RL algorithms with large language models. **For those who are interested in working with me, feel free to drop me an email.**
